## What does it do?
Running this code will intiate the memory game, *Remember the Lights!* In this game, you will test your memory skills by observing the circuit boardâ€™s flashing LEDs for 10 seconds and counting how many times there was a white flash of light. To truly test the capabilities of your memory, there are three levels of difficulty per mode, where the LEDs will flash for shorter periods of time as the level of difficulty increases. 

## What are the game rules?
1. Navigate through the three levels of difficulty by pressing the left and right buttons. The selected level of difficulty can be seen in the Serial Monitor.

     a. Left button decreases the level of difficulty

     b. Right button increases the level of difficulty

2. Once you are ready to start the level, flip the switch once. All the LEDs will glow white, then turn off, making way for the flashing LEDs. 
3. Do not unplug the circuit board at any time 
4. Do not switch out of a level while it is still running, please wait until the LEDs stop flashing 
5. Do not write down your guess anywhere, you must keep your guess in your mind 
6. Do not enter a guess until prompted by the game 
7. When toggling the buttons or switch, do not overload them (i.e. do not press them rapidly)
8. If you have any questions, please ask the game creator 
9. Have fun!
